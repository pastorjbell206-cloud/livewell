I grew up in the kind of church where the rules were clear and the questions were discouraged. Fundamentalism gave me structure, but it also gave me a version of God who was more interested in my behavior than my heart. It took me years to realize that the system I was defending was the very thing keeping me from the Jesus I claimed to follow.

Leaving that world cost me. It cost relationships, positions, and the kind of certainty that makes life feel manageable. But it gave me something I didn't know I was missing: freedom. Not the reckless kind — the kind that comes from finally being honest about what you believe and why.

## What I do now

I write. I teach. I lead. But always from one conviction: behavior modification was never the point. Heart transformation is.

This site is the intellectual and pastoral home of that voice. It's where I think out loud about theology, justice, leadership, and what it looks like to follow Jesus in a world that's forgotten what his kingdom actually stands for.

## Why I Write

There was a moment—I can still see it clearly—when I realized that the American church had made a catastrophic mistake. We had confused our political preferences with our theological convictions. We had baptized nationalism as if it were gospel. We had prioritized institutional protection over prophetic witness. And most painfully, we had done it all while quoting Scripture.

That moment broke something open in me. I couldn't unsee it. I couldn't go back to the comfortable certainty that had defined so much of my faith life. I realized that silence was complicity, and complicity was a kind of betrayal—not just of my own conscience, but of the Jesus I actually believed in.

So I started writing. Not because I have all the answers—I don't. But because I believe the church needs voices willing to ask the hard questions, to name the uncomfortable truths, and to insist that following Jesus means something radically different than what we've been sold. I write because I love the church enough to grieve what she's become, and I believe she can become something better. I write because someone needs to say the things that are being whispered in coffee shops and small group meetings but never from the pulpit. And I write because I genuinely believe that heart transformation—real, deep, costly transformation—is still possible.

## What You'll Find Here

This is a space for serious theological thinking that doesn't require a seminary degree to understand. You'll find essays organized around five core convictions: **Prophetic Disruption** (what needs to be challenged), **Theological Depth** (what needs to be understood), **Prophetic Justice** (what needs to be named), **Integrated Life** (what needs to be lived), and **Leadership Formation** (what leaders need to face). Some articles will comfort you. Some will challenge you. Some might make you angry. All of them are written by someone who believes that faith should be intellectually honest, pastorally compassionate, and prophetically courageous.`;
