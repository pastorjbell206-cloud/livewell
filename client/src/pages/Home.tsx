            James Bell is the Lead Teaching Pastor at First Baptist Church of Fenton and founder of the Pastors Connection Network, connecting pastors across denominational lines around the gospel and kingdom advancement. He trains pastors globally, with particular focus on pastors in remote regions and indigenous tribes.

            His platform, LiveWell by James Bell, is built on a single conviction: American Christianity has domesticated the gospel. His writing exposes the comfortable assumptions, unexamined traditions, and systems that serve institutions more than people. He writes with theological depth, prophetic clarity, and pastoral honesty.
